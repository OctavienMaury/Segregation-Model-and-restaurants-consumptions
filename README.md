# Long-Term Effects of Revealing Ethnicity of Restaurant Owners on Consumer Behavior

This code is developed to explore the potential long-term impact on consumer behavior when the ethnicity of restaurant owners is disclosed. It is inspired by the findings in the paper "The Benefits of Revealing Race: Evidence from Minority-owned Local Businesses" by Abhay Aneja, Michael Luca, and Oren Reshef, which assesses the influence of such disclosures on consumer spending. The limitations in the temporal scope of the paper prevent it from providing definitive conclusions on the policy's effectiveness.

## Theoretical Framework

The approach taken by this code is to integrate the idea of revealing the ethnicity of restaurant owners with Thomas Schelling’s Segregation model. The foundational code is based on the methodologies described in "Segregation dynamics with reinforcement learning and agent-based modeling" by Egemen Sert, Yaneer Bar‐Yam, and Alfredo J. Morales.

## Implementation Details

- **Model:** Agent-Based Model (ABM)
- **Learning Technique:** Reinforcement Learning
- **Key Parameter:** `alpha`
  - **Description:** Measures the tolerance of individuals
  - **Range:** 0 to 1

## Usage

You are free to use and modify this code according to your needs. Adjusting the `alpha` parameter is particularly crucial to tailor the model's behavior to specific scenarios.
